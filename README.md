BubbleSortSimulation
====================

This is the simulation of how Bubble Sort works using JavaScript and HTML elements.
User can vary various elements such as number of elements and range of random geenrated elements.
Code currently supports only sorting of positive integers and I am working on adding support for this feature.

In the meantime if you wish to see any more features to this project let me know.
